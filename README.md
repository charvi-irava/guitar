 ## Electric Guitar vs Acoustic Guitar
Both types of guitars are beatiful instruments with pros and cons. It is important to keep in mind a list of these pros in cons in order to determine what type of sound you are trying to generate for a certain song. The biggest difference between the acoustic and electric guitar is how they are desgined and the sounds they generate. Acoustic guitars produce noise due to the vibration of the strings strumming, and electric guitars produce noise with electricity.
